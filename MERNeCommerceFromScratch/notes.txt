23. Getting started with postman. 

-Created a Collection of api calls.
-created a folder inside of the collection Proshop for all product endpoints. 
- created an environment variable {{URL}} so that you dont have to type in http://localhost:5000 in each of the api GET requests.
Also once the data base has a domain, you can easily replace the variable with the correct domain and replace the localhost domain.

25. an overview of Redux
    - action creators(functions that dispatch actions) are created inside of components.
        example: inside and action creator you can have a fetch request from an api and store the data then send that data through dispatching and action with a payload of that res.data
    -the reducer receives the action and then runs a switch statement then a function is ran based on the action that was dispatched.
