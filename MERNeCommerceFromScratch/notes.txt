section 4: 

23. Getting started with postman. 

-Created a Collection of api calls.
-created a folder inside of the collection Proshop for all product endpoints. 
- created an environment variable {{URL}} so that you dont have to type in http://localhost:5000 in each of the api GET requests.
Also once the data base has a domain, you can easily replace the variable with the correct domain and replace the localhost domain.
